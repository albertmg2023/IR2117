[4.239s]   By not providing "Findexample_interfaces.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
[4.239s]   project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
[4.239s]   "example_interfaces", but CMake did not find one.
[4.239s] 
[4.239s]   Could not find a package configuration file provided by

[4.239s] 
[4.239s]   Add the installation prefix of "example_interfaces" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
[4.240s]   set "example_interfaces_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above
